PROJECT IDEA

Inspired by the idea of slideshare, and at the same time, knowing the inability of thouands to create a ppt on their own, we plan to create a platform where user can upload his/her data and the platform can automate the entire process and generate a  ppt for him/her.

2. To provide a service where we can simplify what the doctor is saying and presenting it to the patient in an easy format.

2.1 WHAT'S LEFT TO DO:
- text to speech code neds to be written 
- code needs to be updated ith the UI
- Sentiment analysis has to be done on the data
